                        (Updated February 2021)


==========================================================================


1. OVERVIEW

This directory contains all the source code and makefiles for
WARP3D. All source code is in *.f files. Modules are named "mod...".

We support WARP3D on:

    o Windows (64-bit) 
    o Linux 64-bit (tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
    o Mac OS 10.15 (built on Catalina. May well work on Big Sur)

We use the Intel Fortran compiler as the primary compiler on all
3 platforms.

On Linux, the gfortran compiler works every well.

On Mac OSX, the gfortran compiler works very well if can be configured to
run on your system -- this is sometimes not straightforward !

See the specific README files for each platform in the top level
directory.

2. MAXIMUM SIZE OF MODELS

No size limits. All global arrays are dynamically allocated.

The "main" program for WARP3D is in the file "main_program.f".

2. BUILD/COMPILE PROCESS  ** Important **

Please see the Quickstart document for each platform for complete,
up-to-date procedures to rebuild the ode on each platform.
